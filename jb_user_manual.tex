		Then did he raise on high the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, saying, 
		"Bless this, O Lord, that with it thou mayst blow thine enemies to tiny 
		bits, in thy mercy." And the people did rejoice and did feast upon the 
		lambs and toads and tree-sloths and fruit-bats and orangutans and 
		breakfast cereals ... Now did the Lord say, "First thou pullest the Holy 
		Pin. Then thou must count to three. Three shall be the number of the 
		counting and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt 
		thou not count, neither shalt thou count two, excepting that thou then 
		proceedeth to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the 
		number of the counting, be reached, then lobbest thou the Holy Hand 
		Grenade in the direction of thine foe, who, being naughty in my sight, 
		shall snuff it."

	Big long paragraph about how our product is dangerous and you 
	really shouldn't do this or that unless you seriously want to be electrecuted. 
	This is a bunch of car batteries and even one car battery would hurt you. In 
	the movies they use car batteries to torture people so why on earth would 
	you think about touching the prong thingies, you will die.
