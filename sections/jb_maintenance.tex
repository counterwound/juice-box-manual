\subsection{\Large{Lifespan of Batteries and Care}}

Batteries naturally self-discharge over time.  To prevent degradation of the batteries, the device should not be stored for extended periods of time without being charged.  It is recommended that the device be charged continuously when not in use.  This maintains the batteries at the float voltage necessary to prevent degradation until the next use.
