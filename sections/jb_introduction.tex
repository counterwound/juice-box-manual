\textbf{Why use the JuiceBox?} \break 
There are some times that you need power without any outlets in range and a noisy, gas powered generator just won't work. How will you power the sound system at an outdoor wedding without the noise of a generator drowning out the service? This is just one of the many times that having a quiet power supply is invaluable.
