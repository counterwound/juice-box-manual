\subsection{\Large{Lifespan of Batteries and Care}}

Batteries naturally self-discharge over time.  To prevent degradation of the batteries, the device should not be stored for extended periods of time without being charged.  It is recommended that the device be charged continuously when not in use.  This maintains the batteries at the float voltage necessary to prevent degradation until the next use.  With proper care, the expected lifespan of the battery pack is approximately 3 years.  This does not apply to devices in which the manufacturer-provided batteries have been replaced.

\subsection{\Large{Limited Warranty}}

The manufacturer will uphold the existing product warranties of various components.  The batteries and inverter come with a 1 year manufacturer warranty.  Cables, mechanical fasteners, handles, and other hardware are under warranty for 5 years.  This warranty applies only to components subjected to normal use and reasonable conditions.  The warranty does not apply in the event that the user disassembles, modifies, or intentionally harms any part of the JuiceBox, except with express permission from or at the direction of the manufacturer.
