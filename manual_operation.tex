\subsection{\Large{How to Use}} 

The JuiceBox is intended to serve as a battery powered AC power supply with an integrated battery charger.  120 VAC outputs in the form of standard wall outlets are available on the casing, while the charger input takes the form of a standard device power cable.  Device performance information is output via an integrated display (shown below).

	\item{2: Charger Input Voltage}
	\item{3: Battery Pack DC Voltage}
	\item{4: Output Load (Percentage of 2000W Capacity)}
	\item{5: Alarm/Fault Indicator}
	\item{6: Output Voltage and Frequency}
	\item{7: Battery Charge Indicator}
	\item{8: Display Wakeup Button}
\end{itemize}

The JuiceBox power switch has two "on" settings, one with power saver enabled and another with power saver disabled.  The battery charge indicator displays the battery charge level in 25 percent increments, with all four sections illuminated when the device is above 75 percent charge.  The display wakeup button is used to wake the display from sleep mode when the device is powered on.  The alarm indicator registers a low battery alarm, while the fault indicator monitors the occurrence of over-current faults in which the load exceeds device capacity.  Exceeding device current limits will trip the internal breaker; to reset this breaker, fully depress the corresponding button located on the device casing (shown below).

\subsection{\Large{Charging the JuiceBox}}

The juice box should be charged for a minimum of 8 hours following full discharge to restore to full charge.  Draining the batteries frequently and failing to fully recharge them in between uses may contribute to degradation of the batteries, resulting in reduced battery life.  The device can be charged by plugging the charging cord into any standard 120 VAC wall outlet and turning the power switch to one of the "on" settings.

\subsection{\Large{Battery Life}}

The juice box can supply up to 16.5 A at 120 VAC.  Battery life is inversely related to current draw; for greater loads, corresponding battery life per charge is reduced.  The graph below shows the relationship between maximum battery life and the percentage of the maximum load.
